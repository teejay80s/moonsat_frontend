Welcome to the Moonsat application! This repository contains both the backend and frontend code for the Moonsat project.

## Backend Setup

### 1. Clone the Backend Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/teejay80s/moonsat_backend.git
2. Navigate into the Backend Directory
bash
Copy code
cd moonsat_backend
3. Read the README File
Open the README.md file in the moonsat_backend directory using a text editor or by navigating to the directory in your file explorer.

4. Follow the Startup Instructions
Look for instructions on how to start the backend server. Typically, it involves running npm install to install dependencies and then npm start to start the server.

5. Install Backend Dependencies
If the README mentions installing dependencies, run:

bash
Copy code
npm install
6. Start the Backend Server
Once dependencies are installed, start the backend server by running:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Frontend Setup
1. Clone the Frontend Repository

This will start the frontend development server, and you should be able to access the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
